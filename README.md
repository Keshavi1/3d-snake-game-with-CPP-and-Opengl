# 3d-snake-game-with-c---and-opengl

I'm back! It's been a while hasn't it. As you can see I have ben working on learning C++ and openGL. 

And oh boy was that stressful. Anyway, lets talk about the thing I made. 

Its a 3d version of the 2d snake game. It works as you would expect.
If you havn't played snake then here is the gist of the game.

You are a snake flying through space. Your goal is to eat the read apples and avoid your tail.
I also added some other obsticals for you to avoid as well.

And also, I will update this as I learn to do more with openGL. 

Controls:
D: turns you to the right of whatever direction your moving
A: turns you to the left of whatever direction your moving
W: makes you go up from whatever direction your moving
S: makes you go down from whatever direction your moving

P/R: pauses/resumes the game
